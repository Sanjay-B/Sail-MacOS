# Sail-MacOS
Our core Mac App for the Sail Community Project

## Development 

Unlike most chat applications, Sail is created for Mac. With many applications today using technologies such as C# and JS, we plan to use as much Swift (a native language to MacOS) to create our app. This means there will be better addaption of newer technology, less bugs, and better flow of the app.

## Roadmap

Please see your development lead for your goals beyond what is listed. These are not yet publicly available.
